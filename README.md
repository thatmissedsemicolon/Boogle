HW X - Boggle Game

-------------------------------------------
Description of how to use the interface:
-------------------------------------------

The opening menu displays the "start game" button to begin the game, a "rules" button (which displays the Boggle game rules), and the "exit" button to exit the game.

To play the virtual game, the player plays similarly to a physical boggle game by writing their words on paper to keep track of their words. The board is "shaken" upon the start of the game by displaying a board of randomized letters. The player creates their words by clicking on the letters of the board to create the word they want to submit, then clicking the "submit word" button. The game keeps track of words that have already been used and checks the validity of words as they are submitted and lets the user know if the player has already submitted a word or if a submitted word is invalid. A timer begins from the time the board is displayed, and the user can submit words for the duration of the standard 3-minute Boggle game time. During game play, the player also has the option to reset the game by clicking the "reset game" button, or to rotate the letters on the board by clicking the "rotate letters" button.

The game keeps track of the highest score achieved by any player and displays the final score at the end of the round upon completion of the game time.
